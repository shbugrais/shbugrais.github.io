Long ago in the land of ancient Kuwait, lived a young foxy lady named Aysha. Aysha possessed the archetype of the innocent, the lover, and the magician. Aysha was a symbol of beauty and grace, every woman wanted to be her. She had lashes so long every blink would blow you away and eyeliner so sharp it could kill a man. Nobody is perfect however, although she had the exterior of a Goddess she lacked driving skills, every time she would touch the steering wheel she’d knock down a light pole somewhere. Aysha was a romantic, her lover wasn’t too far away from her, his name was Mohammed, he worked as her hotline supervisor, she would dream of the day his parents would arrange they’re marriage. Aysha is an extremist, and terrorism fighting hero who will stop at nothing to save the lives of the innocent.</big></p>
